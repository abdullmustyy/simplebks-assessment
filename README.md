#### Endpoints

##### `/order_items`

* **GET**
  * Lists all order items that belong to the logged-in user.
  * Allow sorting by `price` or `shipping_limit_date` (default).
  * Allow showing from 20 (default) to up to 100 results at once with a `limit` parameter, and an `offset` query parameter to also easily get different result pages. The response should be in the format:

    json
    {
     data:[{
      id: order_item_id,
      product_id: product_id,
      product_category: products.product_category_name
      price: price,
      date: shipping_limit_date
     }],
     total: 90214,
     limit: 20,
     offset: 560
    }

##### `/order_items/:id`

* **DELETE**

  * Should return new seller city and state as a response.
